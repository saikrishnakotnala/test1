✅ Slide 3: Theme 1 – Invisible AI Agents

Session: The Invisible Workforce: AI Agents Behind the ScenesSpeaker: Rama Akkiraju, NVIDIA Fellow, NVIDIA

Key Takeaways:

AI agents automate critical backend workflows: infra, deployments, cloud ops, and security.

Reduces manual errors, improves reliability, frees human resources for innovation.

Practical Applications at ABCD:

Automate patching, server health checks, and compliance audits in AWS/Azure environments.

Use anomaly detection agents to monitor trading systems and flag unusual activities.

Apply agents to streamline batch processing and back-office reconciliations.

Session: Supercharge Agentic AI AppsSpeaker: Sathya Raghavendran, Principal Architect, Thoughtworks

Key Takeaways:

Cloud-native scaffolding and modular templates simplify multi-agent system deployment.

Accelerates development, reduces DevOps overhead, increases scalability.

Practical Applications at ABCD:

Build agent frameworks for KYC checks, fraud detection, and compliance workflows.

Deploy scalable, reusable agents supporting financial risk analysis and regulatory processes.

✅ Slide 4: Theme 2 – AI for Developer & Team Productivity

Session: AI Assistance for On-Call EngineersCompany: Atlassian

Key Takeaways:

90% alert noise reduction, 7x faster incident reports, 6-second resource lookups.

Improves incident handling, reduces SRE fatigue, boosts system reliability.

Practical Applications at ABCD:

Integrate AI with Splunk, ServiceNow, Jira to prioritize alerts and triage incidents.

Automate post-incident reports (PIRs) with ABCD-specific operational risk context.

Session: AI for Teams: AI Assistance Beyond CodingSpeaker: Dan Shappir, Dev Advocate, Wix

Key Takeaways:

AI helps teams beyond coding: drafting requirements, summarizing meetings, generating architecture docs.

Fosters better cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Practical Applications at ABCD:

Deploy AI copilots in Confluence, Jira to auto-generate sprint summaries, design docs, retro notes.

Assist PMs and analysts in drafting user stories and feature specs.

✅ Slide 5: Theme 3 – Responsible AI & Ethical Innovation

Session: AI and Ethics: Navigating the Future of Responsible TechnologySpeaker: Harini Suresh, Researcher, Google DeepMind

Key Takeaways:

Addressing bias, ensuring transparency, protecting privacy are essential for trustworthy AI.

Ethical AI is crucial for long-term adoption and stakeholder trust.

Practical Applications at ABCD:

Establish a Responsible AI governance framework to review all internal models.

Implement explainability tools and bias checks for client-facing and regulatory-use models.

Session: Engineering Fundamentals in the Age of AI: Human-in-the-LoopSpeaker: Alex Smola, VP & Distinguished Scientist, AWS AI

Key Takeaways:

Human oversight is essential for high-stakes decisions, balancing automation with accountability.

Human-in-the-loop systems improve compliance and regulatory alignment.

Practical Applications at ABCD:

Embed human review checkpoints in AI-driven loan approvals, flagged AML alerts, and regulatory reporting.

Create feedback loops where employees can refine and validate AI system outputs.

✅ Slide 6: Final Recommendations for ABCD

Short-Term: Pilot backend AI agents for infra monitoring, compliance automation, and anomaly detection.

Mid-Term: Deploy AI triage tools for SRE teams and GenAI copilots across Jira and Confluence.

Long-Term: Build a formal Responsible AI governance structure, embedding explainability and human-in-the-loop safeguards.

Closing Statement: GIDS 2025 highlighted how AI is transforming backend operations, developer workflows, and ethical standards. ABCD can lead the financial sector by carefully piloting these innovations for both operational efficiency and long-term trust.
