Slide 2: The Invisible Workforce ‚Äì AI Agents in Backend Ops
Importance of the Session:

Showcased how autonomous AI agents are already automating cloud infrastructure, deployment pipelines, cybersecurity tasks, and data flows ‚Äî quietly and reliably.

Moved the conversation away from chatbots and toward deep, functional automation.

Strategic Takeaway for ABCD:

AI agents can offload repetitive and error-prone infrastructure tasks, reduce ops load, and increase consistency in backend workflows.

Brings us closer to true self-healing systems in ops and infra.

What We Can Implement:

Pilot autonomous agents for:

Automated patching and remediation in AWS/Azure environments.

Cloud config compliance checks.

Event-driven data archival or backup agents.

Use existing AI stacks (e.g., ServiceNow Virtual Agent, internal orchestration tools) for integration.

Streamlined and humanized the incident response pipeline.

Strategic Takeaway for ABCD:

We can significantly reduce cognitive load on SREs and Ops engineers, enabling faster response and higher system uptime.

Ideal for improving our production support metrics and MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution).

What We Can Implement:

Integrate AI summarization tools with Jira, Splunk, Grafana to auto-summarize incidents.

Use NLP agents to generate PIRs from logs, runbooks, and Slack threads.

Deploy fine-tuned models trained on our internal on-call SOPs.

‚ö° Slide 4: Low-Code + AI: Building Internal Tools Faster

Reduced dependency on engineering for internal applications.

Strategic Takeaway for ABCD:

AI + low-code can empower non-technical teams (Ops, Compliance, HR) to create useful internal tools.

Accelerates workflow digitization and reduces backlog on engineering teams.

What We Can Implement:

Use Microsoft Power Apps + Copilot to enable business teams to:

Build form-based approval workflows.

Automate internal reporting dashboards.

Create quick MVPs for internal tools (e.g., scheduling, ticketing, inventory).

Governance framework to manage access, data boundaries, and audit logs.

üß† Slide 5: Supercharging Agentic AI Apps

Focused on developer experience and operational ease.

Strategic Takeaway for ABCD:

A standardized agentic scaffolding framework could reduce the cost and time to deploy intelligent AI agents across use cases ‚Äî customer support, finance ops, HR, compliance.

What We Can Implement:

Build an internal LLM Agent Platform with:

Pre-built templates for common functions (query routing, summarization, ticketing).

Integration with Azure OpenAI, Kafka, Snowflake.

Pre-configured observability and rollback.

Roll out for specific use cases like fraud insight extraction, internal search agents, etc.

üë• Slide 6: AI for Teams ‚Äì Beyond Coding
Importance of the Session:

Explored how AI can assist in requirements analysis, architecture planning, documentation, and collaborative work‚Äînot just code generation.

Focused on amplifying team productivity, not replacing roles.

Strategic Takeaway for ABCD:

Teams spend hours in documentation, analysis, and coordination ‚Äî AI can cut this time and create consistency.

Boosts agility, especially in cross-functional squads.

What We Can Implement:

AI agents to:

Generate architecture diagrams from confluence pages.

Draft Jira tickets from meeting transcripts.

Convert meeting notes into action items with deadlines.

Embed Copilot across tools like Microsoft Teams, Miro, and Jira.

üìä Slide 7: LLMs + Data Platforms for Natural Language Analytics
Importance of the Session:

Demonstrated serverless, secure integrations of LLMs with data lakes and warehouses using Streamlit and native LLM APIs.

Enabled business users to ask natural language questions about data.

Strategic Takeaway for ABCD:

Enables data democratization ‚Äî PMs, auditors, and analysts can interact with datasets without needing SQL or dashboards.

What We Can Implement:

Enable natural language querying of internal datasets via:

Streamlit or internal dashboard tools.

Azure OpenAI models fine-tuned on structured financial data.

Strong focus on RBAC, data masking, and audit trails.

üèÅ Slide 8: Final Recommendations
Short-Term (0‚Äì3 Months):

Identify 2-3 teams for agent-based POCs.

Integrate AI-generated PIRs and alert summarization for one SRE squad.

Mid-Term (3‚Äì6 Months):

Establish a standard AI agent scaffolding framework.

Pilot low-code + AI toolkits with Ops and Compliance teams.

Long-Term (6‚Äì12 Months):

Create an internal AI Marketplace for reusable tools and models.

Roll out conversational analytics for 2 business units.
